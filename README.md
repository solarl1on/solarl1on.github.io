This is a repo about OURS.  
What is OURS, anyways?!  

Well, we're writing ... to find out, together.

For starters, OURS is LOVE.

LOVE is FREE. All powerful.  
Divine inheritance. 

LOVE is OURS.  

Culture?
Well, that's made by us, together.  
Our ancestors.  Our traditions.

Culture can't be made a product just yet. 
Lord knows they've tried. 

Culture in all its hyperlocal plurality federated beauty of wedding boquets and wildflow blooms. 
OURS, too.  

Hope, Faith, Moral Law, Ethics, Empathy, Divinity. 
OURS.

Wisdom Traditions towards Collective Liberation.  
Freedom that is Wild Woven together by Wildlings.
Free Folks from beyond the Walls. 

That's OURS.  

P - Peace?  Yes m'aam.   
L - Love? Yes sir.
U - Unity?  Takes work.
R - Respect.  Give to get. 

_PLUR, the Cultural Movement we need._

Supreme.
